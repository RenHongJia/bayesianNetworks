# Machine Learning for Fault Detection of Energy Consumption #

A machine learning approach for fault detection of enery consumption
values in a room.

![Alt The relax room](img/room.png)

As depicted in the figure above, there is only one door to access the
room. On the opposite side there is a wide window. In the bottom-right corner
there are three electrical appliances: a microwave, a kettle, and a
water dispenser.

This room is equipped with the following sensors:

1. open/close sensor on the windows;
2. temperature and humidity sensor near the window;
3. temperature and movement sensor near the door;
4. energy consumption sensor, called _Z-Plug_, on which all the electrical appliances are plugged.
